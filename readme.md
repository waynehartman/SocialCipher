# SocialCypher

This is an app I threw together inspired by [a tweet](https://twitter.com/parrots/status/942110648254726145) from [@parrots](https://twitter.com/parrots/).  Star Wars spoilers abound, but why hold your tongue when you can 'speak' in cypher so that people don't inadvertently get spoiled on social media?

No need to copy/paste within the app.  Cypher text will automatically paste into the app when you switch to it and also will be copied to the pasteboard when you leave.

Enjoy!
